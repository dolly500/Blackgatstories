                            Dotun Popoola is a synergetic metal sculptor who has carved a niche for himself with his polychromatic scrap metal works. Born in Agege, Lagos, in April 1981, Dotun had his primary and secondary education in Agege, Lagos. He had his first and second degrees in Fine and Applied Arts with specialisations in sculpture and painting, respectively, at Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Nigeria. Dotun trained in several art studios before and after his university education. He was certified as a hybrid metal sculptor at John Lopez Studio in South Dacota, USA, in 2015. Dotun has won several awards, including the Director General’s Award for the Best Artist of the Year in the 2009 NYSC Arts Competition, which was the maiden edition.
                            Dotun was featured in 2018 at the West Africa International Art Fair, “ARTX Lagos.” He represented Nigeria at the maiden scrap art exhibition in Souq Waqif, Qatar, in 2019 and at the Global Art Festival in Gujarat, India, in 2020. Additionally, he participated in Coexistence in Turkey in 2021 and the valuable scraps exhibition in Turkey in 2022. His hybrid sculpture took centre stage at the Nigerian pavilion at Expo 2020 in Dubai, leaving world leaders speechless. Dotun has participated in thirty (30) group, fourteen (14) joint, and six (6) solo exhibitions. He is passionate about touching lives through his artistic and leadership skills, turning trash into treasures and rubbish into rubies.
